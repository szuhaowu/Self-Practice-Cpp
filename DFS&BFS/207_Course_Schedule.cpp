//There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.
//
//Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
//
//Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
//
// 
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
//Output: true
//Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
//             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
//Output: false
//Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
//             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
//             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
